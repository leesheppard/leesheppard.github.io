<p>Ever plugged in an external hard drive or USB only to have it blink and not show up in your network?</p>

<p>I had a system crash unexpectedly on my desktop Mac and when it rebooted, I had trouble with the system starting up. There was an external hard drive still plugged in and the hardware was attempting to use it to boot a system to load with.</p>

<p>Unplugging the hard drive allowed the system from the internal drive to boot successfully. But the external hard drive disappeared when plugged back in.</p>

<p>What is happening? well Mac wants to fix the boot files on the external hard drives to prevent any issues with loss of data. It runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fsck</code> which stands for “File System Consistency Check,” is a command-line tool that reviews and repairs the underlying structure of a hard drive.</p>

<p>If you open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Activity Monitor</code> on the Mac with the hard drive plugged in, you’ll see this running. Force quit it.</p>

<p>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disk Utility</code> and you’ll see the disk in the left pane window, if it isn’t mounted you can click to mount in the far right top of the window.</p>

<p>Select the hard drive and Repair Permissions. It may take a while but will resolve the issues with viewing the hard drive contents.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can try in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Terminal</code> to use the following commands:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ diskutil list
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Find your HDD identifier.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk*
$ diskutil eject /dev/disk*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace * with your version</p>
